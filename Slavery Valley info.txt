Hey guys,

this is my official release of the Battleground i made a year ago. 
(See post Custom Battleground to have a look at the Battleground)
in the attached file you'll find the following files:

DOWNLOAD Slavery Valley

- Folder Map: this contains the adt and the wdt files
- Folder Minimap: this are the minimap png's and the map png's (you don't need this folder but i will share it too)
- Folder Patch: here are all the  seperated files from the Patch for the BG (not in mpq Format)
- BattlegroundSV.cpp.txt: this is the C++ .cpp file you should implement in your source code
- BattlegroundSV.h.txt: this is the C++ .h file you schould implement in your soure code
- BattlegroundSV.sql: this contains 3 npcs some npc text and trinity strings
- Patch-S.mpq: this is the Patch for your Client. (Contains the same files like the Patch folder)

So let's start implementing the Battleground. I'm sure i will forget some steps so if you have trouble implementing this just post your fix if you got one or tell me so i can tell you what to do. 
The Battleground is for TrinityCore 3.3.5a and for the english Client because this are all english dbc's.

Step 1:

First make a backup of your Server dbc files, than take all the DBC's files from the Patch/DBFilesClient Folder and copy and past it in your Server DBC's. 


Step 2:

Execute the SQL File to your database. The file won't overwrite any existing data.


Step 3:

Now starts the C++ part. Get a new blank .cpp and .h file to your Source code. Name it BattlegroundSV.cpp and BattlegroundSV.h. Rebuild and compile your Sourcecode. 
Now copy paste the complete BattlegroundSV.cpp.txt and BattlegroundSV.h.txt to your new C++ files.
If you now try to compile you will see, there are some Errors we need to fix.


Step 4:

Go to the SharedDefines.h and insert a new Battleground.

line 3341(new enum)
Code: [Select]
BATTLEGROUND_SV  = 31,  // Slavery Valley

line 3479(new enum)
Code: [Select]
BATTLEGROUND_QUEUE_SV = 11,


Step 5:

Go to the BattlegroundMgr.cpp. Here we need to insert som lines.

line 36(new include):
Code: [Select]
#include "BattlegroundSV.h"

line 403(new case): 
Code: [Select]
case BATTLEGROUND_SV:
bg = new BattlegroundSV(*(BattlegroundSV*)bg_template);
break;

line 489(new case):
Code: [Select]
case BATTLEGROUND_SV:
bg = new BattlegroundSV();
break;

line 757(new case):
Code: [Select]
case BATTLEGROUND_SV:
return BATTLEGROUND_QUEUE_SV;

line 797(new case):
Code: [Select]
case BATTLEGROUND_QUEUE_SV:
return BATTLEGROUND_SV;

Step 6:

need to add some code in the language.h you can place it whereever you want in the trinitystrings sector. i placed it next to the other bg Messages.
Code: [Select]
LANG_BG_SV_START_TWO_MINUTES = 1500,
LANG_BG_SV_START_ONE_MINUTE = 1501,
LANG_BG_SV_START_HALF_MINUTE = 1502,
LANG_BG_SV_HAS_BEGUN = 1503,

LANG_BG_SV_TAKEN = 3001,
LANG_BG_SV_DEFENDED = 3002,
LANG_BG_SV_ASSAULTED = 3003,
LANG_BG_SV_ALLY = 3004,
LANG_BG_SV_HORDE = 3005,
LANG_BG_SV_MINE = 3006,
LANG_BG_SV_PRISON = 3007,
LANG_BG_SV_RESTLESSGRAVEYARD = 3008,
LANG_BG_SV_BOSS_INC_1MIN = 3009,
LANG_BG_SV_BOSS_INC_NOW = 3010,

That's it as far as i still knew it. If you compile now there could be some undefined names so check what names are missing but i think this is all what is needed. 

To get it completle working you need to Export the map, mmaps and vmaps of the map.
Now you can put the Patch-S.mpq into your data folder of your Client and it should work.

If you use it please give some Feedback of the functionality of the bg and if you use it on a Server please tell me which Server you are using it on so i maybe can take a look
